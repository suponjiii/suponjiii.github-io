      How it's going to work
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You contact me through one of the methods mentioned below</li>
      <li>
        If you’re willing to pay, it’s basically guaranteed I accept, if not
        I’ll have to see if I have time! BUT PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU PAY OR NOT
        BEFOREHAND!
      </li>
      <li>
        If I accept, you give me the song, the off vocal and if you already have
        them, your lines. Tell me additional things (effects etc.) too!
      </li>
      <li>Also, if you pay you can set a deadline so I won’t be lazy!</li>
      <li>
        I will send an invoice with a partial payment before I start. Upon
        payment, sit back, enjoy and wait till I’m done
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ll send you in a Critmix (unmastered and Preview-Quality) in which I
        have done most of the things...In that mix, you can tell me which things
        to change (Volumes, effects, timing, everything basically)
      </li>
      <li>
        You happy? Then I am happy. Full mix, Upload and possibly payment!
      </li>
    </ol>
