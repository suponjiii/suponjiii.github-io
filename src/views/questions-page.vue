        Paypal preferably! If you have any other suggestions, feel free to tell
        me about them though that’s the easiest and most used one around here so
        I guess Paypal would be optimal. Also, I’m European so you’d have to pay
        me in euros! (Though I think Paypal can automatically convert currency
        anyway)

        I really like this website! Can I have one of my own?

        Yes! However, if you generally just want something fancier than a Google
        Docs page and don't really want a specific design, it's probably cheaper
        to go with services like <a href="https://carrd.co">carrd</a>. But if
        your needs go beyond that, feel free to hit me up!
