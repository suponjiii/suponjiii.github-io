      <p>
        Paypal preferably! If you have any other suggestions, feel free to tell
        me about them though that’s the easiest and most used one around here so
        I guess Paypal would be optimal. Also, I’m European so you’d have to pay
        me in euros! (Though I think Paypal can automatically convert currency
        anyway)

      <h4 class="subtitle">Do you collaborate with other mixers?</h4>
      <p>
        Sure can do! Especially if the work’s divided then (Tuning, Timing,
        Mixing), we can talk about that of course!

        I really like this website! Can I have one of my own?

      <p>
        For sure! I am studying Computer Science and have experience in Web
        Development. Just shoot me a message and we might be able to arrange
        something!
